mtgreatest is a project to deliver advanced analytics and analytics-based content centered on 
professional magic events and the performance of the players in those tournaments. The core
data driving this project will be a database of players with their event results and an Elo
rating for each event. Content based on this data will include a continuously-updated ranking
of current top players, all-time top lists, and projections for upcoming tournaments.

Project packages:
mtgreatest-py - python scripts for the scraping of data, population of tables, and statistical 
  analysis of event results
mtgreatest-server - nodejs server delivering content and comminication with MySQL database
mtgreatest-client - user-facing web application

inspiration for this project is drawn from fiverthirtyeight and quick_mtgstat
